    This subclass of :class:`auraxium.Client` extends the interface to
    also provide access to the WebSocket endpoint at
    ``wss://push.planetside2.com/streaming``.

    To use the websocket endpoint, you have to define a
    :class:`~auraxium.event.Trigger` and register it using the
    :meth:`add_trigger` method. This will automatically open a
    WebSocket connection is there is not already one running. Likewise,
    removing all event triggers from the client will cause the
    underlying websocket connection to close.

    Refer to the :class:`~auraxium.event.Trigger` class's documentation
    for details on how to use triggers and respond to events.
